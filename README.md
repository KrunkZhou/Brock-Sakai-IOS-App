# Brock Sakai IOS App

This app is discontinued since I am graduated, but it should still works 
perfectly.

Notification "sakaiNoti" No longer works after Sakai 21 Update.

This app is for my personal use / share with closest friends, thus there's no english language in it, but you can easily translate them by google translate.

You can compile the Xcode project yourself by this [Guide](https://github.com/PRAN1999/SakaiClientiOS/blob/master/README.md#setting-up-dev-environment).

This app is a modified version with bugs fix and brock system optimization from https://github.com/PRAN1999/SakaiClientiOS.
